        A list of authors/artists preferred by the group (e.g., ['Picasso', 'Dal√≠']).
    preferred_themes : list of str
        A list of thematic preferences (e.g., ['landscapes', 'portraits']).
    time_coefficient : float
        A coefficient representing time constraints or preferences (1=normal speed, <1=faster, >1=slower).
    proposed_paintings : list of str
        The list of paintings included in the proposed route.
    route_score : float
        A guiding score for the route's interest or quality.
    perfect_route_score : float, optional
        The score considered as perfect. Default is 10.
    textual_feedback : str
        Determines the level of textual feedback in addition to the numeric evaluation.
        Options:
        - 'None': Only numeric evaluation and empty feedback line.
        - 'short': Numeric evaluation + very short good/bad feedback sentence.
        - 'full': Numeric evaluation + brief but more detailed feedback (original prompt style).

    Returns
    -------
    str
        A string containing two lines:
        - First line: "Evaluation: n/5"
        - Second line: "Feedback: ..." according to the chosen textual_feedback style.
