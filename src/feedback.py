    group_type : str
        The type of group (e.g., 'school', 'family', 'casual').
    group_description : str
        A description of the group composition and interests.
    art_knowledge_level : int
        An integer from 1 to 4 indicating the level of artistic knowledge of the group (1=low, 4=high).

        Elevator Usage: Would the group prefer only elevators? (True / False).
